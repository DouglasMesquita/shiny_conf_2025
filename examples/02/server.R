# What to test?
#
# Second scenario: retrieving adjusted MET in a reactive
# Try changing the age, gender, and activity inputs â€” it will trigger all computations repeatedly!
#
# Why is this a problem?
# It's suboptimal for several reasons:
# - Changing age should not affect gender or MET factors.
# - Changing gender should not affect age or MET factors.
# - Changing activity should not affect age or gender factors.
