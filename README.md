# Welcome!

Hi! 👋  
Thanks for checking out the materials for my talk **"Why Is It Triggering Twice? Understanding Shiny Reactivity"** at the [Shiny Conference 2025](https://shinyconf.com).

This repository contains:
- 🖥️ The code and examples used in the talk  
- 📄 The slides in PDF format (`shiny_conf_2025.pdf`)

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, make sure you restore the project environment first. This ensures all required packages are installed with the correct versions:

```r
renv::restore()
```

After that, you’re good to go! Dive in, play with the examples, and explore how reactivity works (and sometimes surprises us) in Shiny.

If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to reach out!

Enjoy!
